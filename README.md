# üî• Wildfire Detection ‚Äì Fighting Fires with AI  
Welcome to the **Wildfire Detection Research** repository! Here, we're on a mission to revolutionize wildfire prevention using the power of **computer vision**. Our research focuses on training an advanced **object detection model** to accurately spot fire and smoke in images‚Äîbecause early detection can mean the difference between safety and disaster.

## üöÄ Highlights:

- **üî• Fire Detection with YOLOv8** ‚Äì We trained a cutting-edge YOLOv8 model using the **D-Fire dataset** for highly accurate fire and smoke detection.  
- **üìä Performance Optimization** ‚Äì Explored different model sizes to find the best balance between speed and accuracy.  
- **üñ•Ô∏è Interactive Web App** ‚Äì Developed a **Streamlit-powered demo** so you can test the model in real-time.  
- **üîç Future Potential** ‚Äì Investigated how AI-driven wildfire detection could reshape prevention strategies worldwide.

## üìÇ Dataset ‚Äì D-Fire üî•  
To build a robust model, we leveraged the **[D-Fire dataset](https://github.com/gaiasd/DFireDataset)**‚Äîa **massive collection of 21,000 labeled images**, meticulously annotated in YOLO format. It includes:  

‚úÖ **Fire & Smoke Instances** ‚Äì Clearly labeled occurrences for precise detection.  
‚úÖ **Challenging Visuals** ‚Äì Non-fire images that mimic flames, ensuring robustness.  
‚úÖ **Diverse Scenarios** ‚Äì Different environments and lighting conditions for real-world applicability.

## üöÄ Model Training  

We powered up YOLOv8 by [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) and trained it on the D-Fire dataset to create a fast and reliable fire and smoke detection system. But we didn‚Äôt stop at just accuracy‚Äîwe fine-tuned model parameters and hyperparameters to squeeze out maximum efficiency and speed. üî•  

üí° **Want to see how we trained it?** Check out our **[training-recipes folder](training-recipes)** for a step-by-step breakdown!

## üìä Results  

The results? üî•üî•üî• The trained YOLOv8 model delivered impressive accuracy on the D-Fire test dataset, achieving strong mAP@50 scores while maintaining rapid inference speeds. Below is a snapshot of its performance (evaluated on an NVIDIA A100-SXM4-40, with 640x640 input resolution):
